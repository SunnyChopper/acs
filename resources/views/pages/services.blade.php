							<h4>Open Carrier</h4>
							<hr />
							<p>Open car transport is the quickest and most economical way to ship your car. Most trucks operate an open trailer so there are more available carriers to pick up your car on any given route.</p>
							<p>Insurance begins covering your car from the moment it is loaded to the moment is it is delivered to you. Insurance is included in your quoted price, you should request a copy of insurance from your carrier.</p>
							<p>Car dealerships use open transport when they ship cars from locations all over the country. Some of the largest dealers in the country haul brand new vehicles using open vehicle transport.</p>

							<h4>Enclosed Carrier</h4>
							<hr />
							<p>Your baby needs special treatment? Brand new custom paint job? Hard to find original color? Worried about dirt, grime and hail? Would even a small chip make you cry inconsolably for days? Will you be unable to sleep while it’s being transported?</p>
							<p>All those are reason enough to consider enclosed transport for your car. Most in the industry will steer you to enclosed carriers if your car is:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>At least 50K in value</li>
								<li>An antique</li>
								<li>Luxury or sports car</li>
								<li>Lowered (under 4 inches of ground clearance)</li>
							</ul>

							<h4>Door to Door</h4>
							<hr />
							<p>Most carriers, and brokers, offer door to door transport services but in some cases if an 18 wheeler is transporting your vehicle it is very likely that a more convenient meeting spot will be arranged for pick up and drop off. Large parking spots, larger roads off highways etc. Some townships do not allow 18 wheelers on certain roads as well. Try to build some flexibility into your planning.</p>

							<h4>Storage</h4>
							<hr />
							<p>Depending on the carrier, they might be able to offer storage services in either the drop off or pick up location. Many also partner with local towing yards. Be sure to discuss and agree to any extra fees that would incur. Usually charged per day.</p>

							<h4>Terminal</h4>
							<hr />
							<p>Terminal-to-Terminal auto shipping can sometimes be a cheaper way to move your car. A terminal is a regional storage facility. Located in larger metro areas generally. Cars are dropped off there and stored. Many times that could be outside in the elements.</p>
							<p>Terminals are a good choice for customers looking to drop off or pick up their cars at a specific time and date or if unable to coordinate a door to door transport.</p>
